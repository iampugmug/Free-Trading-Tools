      <h1>Blended Net Liquidity Correlation</h1>

      <p class="section-intro">
        A macro tool that builds a blended net-liquidity model from FRED data and measures how strongly that liquidity has moved with price across multiple time windows.
        The indicator is <strong>free to use</strong> on TradingView; the script is protected.

      <h2>How Traders Recreate This Without the Indicator</h2>

      <p>
        Many traders use public FRED series (WALCL, RRP, TGA, BTFP, etc.) to build their own net liquidity approximations.
        You can recreate similar concepts manually in TradingView using symbol math and overlays.
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Open the symbol search and enter a math expression combining series (example style: <strong>WALCL − RRP − TGA</strong>).</li>
        <li>Apply smoothing (like an SMA) to reduce noise.</li>
        <li>Compare the resulting line to price and test different offsets/timeframes.</li>
        <li>Optionally build multiple variants (with or without WALCL) and compare visually.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        This indicator packages those steps into a clean workflow with component toggles, weighting controls, smoothing, and multi-window correlation so you can explore the same concepts faster.
      </p>

      <h2>Overview</h2>

      <p>
        Many traders use liquidity-based models to understand broad macro conditions and their potential influence on price. While institutional-grade models often rely on proprietary inputs,
        the community frequently studies public FRED series—such as WALCL, RRP, TGA, and BTFP—to construct transparent net-liquidity frameworks that approximate capital movement within the financial system.
      </p>

      <p>
        This script does not replicate or reverse-engineer any commercial macro indicator. Instead, it provides a flexible structure for exploring how different liquidity components interact,
        and how those liquidity dynamics correlate with market price across various time windows. All data comes from standard FRED series, and all calculations are described at a high level for transparency.
      </p>

      <h2>What the Script Does</h2>

      <h3>1. Builds a customizable blended net-liquidity model</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Includes WALCL, RRP, TGA, BTFP, ΔTOTLL, and ΔM2.</li>
        <li>Allows turning each component on/off.</li>
        <li>Provides adjustable weighting for WALCL vs. non-WALCL models.</li>
        <li>Supports optional SMA smoothing of the liquidity series.</li>
        <li>Supports time-offsetting liquidity to study lagging effects.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. Runs multi-period price correlations</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>30D, 60D, 90D, 180D, 1Y, 1.5Y, 2Y, and a custom-length window.</li>
        <li>Displays all correlations in a compact table.</li>
        <li>Automatically highlights the highest-correlation window.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why This Script Is Useful</h2>

      <p>
        Traditional liquidity charts often plot only one variable at a time. This open model adds clarity by combining multiple components into one framework and letting you quantify the relationship to price across time windows.
      </p>

      <h2>Important Notes</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>FRED data updates weekly and may revise historical values.</li>
        <li>Correlation does not imply causation.</li>
        <li>Liquidity models are approximations, not definitive forecasts.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
