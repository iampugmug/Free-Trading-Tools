    <h1>Blended Net Liquidity Correlation</h1>

    <p>
      Many traders use liquidity-based models to understand broad macro conditions and their potential influence on price.
      While institutional-grade models often rely on proprietary inputs, the community frequently studies public FRED series—such as
      WALCL, RRP, TGA, and BTFP—to construct transparent net-liquidity frameworks that approximate capital movement within the financial system.
    </p>

    <p>
      This script does not replicate or reverse-engineer any commercial macro indicator. Instead, it provides a flexible, transparent structure
      for exploring how different liquidity components interact — and how those liquidity dynamics correlate with market price across various time windows.
      The indicator is free to use on TradingView; the script is protected.
    </p>

    <h2>How Traders Recreate This Without the Indicator</h2>

    <p>
      You can approximate similar liquidity views manually in TradingView using public series and symbol math.
      The platform lets you add/subtract series directly, then smooth and compare against price.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Combine public series using symbol math (example style: <strong>WALCL − RRP − TGA</strong>).</li>
      <li>Apply smoothing (like an SMA) to reduce noise.</li>
      <li>Compare the result against price and test different offsets/timeframes.</li>
      <li>Build multiple variants (with or without balance sheet data) and compare behavior.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      This indicator packages those steps into a cleaner workflow with component toggles, blending controls, smoothing options,
      and multi-window correlation analysis.
    </p>

    <h2>What the Script Does</h2>

    <h3>1. Builds a customizable blended net-liquidity model</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Includes components such as <strong>WALCL</strong>, <strong>RRP</strong>, <strong>TGA</strong>, <strong>BTFP</strong>, <strong>ΔTOTLL</strong>, and <strong>ΔM2</strong> (depending on script settings).</li>
      <li>Allows toggling each component on/off.</li>
      <li>Provides adjustable blending/weighting for balance-sheet vs short-term flow models.</li>
      <li>Supports optional SMA smoothing to reduce noise.</li>
      <li>Supports offsetting liquidity to study potential lead/lag relationships.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Runs multi-period price correlations</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Computes correlation between liquidity and price across multiple windows.</li>
      <li>Includes short-term and long-term horizons (e.g., months to years).</li>
      <li>Displays results in a compact table.</li>
      <li>Automatically highlights the strongest correlation window.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Plots liquidity alongside price</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Plots the blended liquidity series directly on the chart for visual comparison.</li>
      <li>Designed to provide macro context, not signals.</li>
      <li>Helps frame liquidity regimes relative to market structure.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Maintains transparency and reproducibility</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>All inputs are public data series; no proprietary feeds required.</li>
      <li>No hidden weighting or undisclosed logic.</li>
      <li>Designed for research and hypothesis testing rather than prediction.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why This Script Is Useful</h2>

    <p>
      Traditional liquidity charts often plot only one variable at a time. This framework adds clarity by combining components into a unified model and allowing you to test which inputs matter most.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Combines multiple macro liquidity components into a single blended series.</li>
      <li>Gives full control over which components are included.</li>
      <li>Provides smoothing and offset tools for cleaner research.</li>
      <li>Offers multi-window correlation to quantify relationships instead of relying on narrative.</li>
      <li>Helps study whether liquidity tends to lead, lag, or coincide with price on your chosen asset.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      This tool is most useful for macro-focused traders, swing traders, crypto/macro analysts, and anyone studying how systemic liquidity interacts with price.
    </p>

    <h2>What This Script Is Not</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Not a recreation of any commercial macro model.</li>
      <li>Not a predictive tool or a “signal service.”</li>
      <li>Not financial advice.</li>
      <li>Correlation is descriptive — it does not guarantee future performance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Use</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Select which liquidity components to include.</li>
      <li>Adjust any blending/weighting settings to emphasize balance-sheet vs flow dynamics.</li>
      <li>Apply smoothing if you want cleaner trend structure.</li>
      <li>Optionally offset liquidity to test lead/lag hypotheses.</li>
      <li>Use correlation windows to see where relationships have historically been strongest.</li>
      <li>Combine with structure, trend, and volume for macro context — not signals.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Important Notes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>FRED data updates weekly and may revise historical values.</li>
      <li>Correlation does not imply causation — it measures relationship, not predictiveness.</li>
      <li>Liquidity models are approximations, not definitive macro forecasts.</li>
      <li>Always validate settings across multiple assets and timeframes.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Not signals. Not alerts. Not shortcuts.</strong></p>
    <p>The goal is to document how indicators work — not to tell anyone when to trade.</p>
    <p><strong>If an indicator can’t be explained down to its underlying mechanics, it probably isn’t understood well enough to trade.</strong></p>

    <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>
      This tool is provided for educational and analytical purposes only. It does not constitute financial advice or a recommendation to trade.
      Always validate settings, test on multiple assets and timeframes, and use proper risk management before trading live.
