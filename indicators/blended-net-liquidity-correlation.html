    <h1>Blended Net Liquidity Correlation</h1>
    <p class="section-intro">
      An open-source macro tool that builds a blended net-liquidity model from FRED data and 
      measures how strongly that liquidity has moved with price across multiple time windows.

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Many traders use liquidity-based models to understand broad macro conditions and their potential influence 
      on price. While institutional-grade models often rely on proprietary inputs, the community frequently 
      studies public FRED series—such as WALCL, RRP, TGA, and BTFP—to construct transparent net-liquidity 
      frameworks that approximate capital movement within the financial system.
    </p>
    <p>
      This script does not replicate or reverse-engineer any commercial macro indicator. Instead, it provides 
      a fully open-source, flexible structure for exploring how different liquidity components interact, and 
      how those liquidity dynamics correlate with market price across various time windows. All data comes 
      from standard FRED series, and all calculations are fully disclosed for complete transparency.
    </p>

    <h2>What the Script Does</h2>

    <h3>1. Builds a customizable blended net-liquidity model</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Includes WALCL, RRP, TGA, BTFP, ΔTOTLL, and ΔM2.</li>
      <li>Allows turning each component on/off.</li>
      <li>Provides adjustable weighting for WALCL vs. non-WALCL models.</li>
      <li>Supports optional SMA smoothing of the liquidity series.</li>
      <li>Supports time-offsetting liquidity to study lagging effects.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Runs multi-period price correlations</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>30D, 60D, 90D, 180D, 1Y, 1.5Y, 2Y, and a custom length window.</li>
      <li>Displays all correlations in a compact table.</li>
      <li>Automatically highlights the highest-correlation window.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Plots the blended liquidity model on the chart</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Plots the liquidity series as an overlay using the right-side scale.</li>
      <li>Makes it easy to visually compare liquidity swings with price structure.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Maintains complete transparency</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>All data is sourced from public FRED datasets.</li>
      <li>No proprietary formulas or hidden signals.</li>
      <li>Designed for research, modification, and extension.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why This Script Is Useful</h2>
    <p>
      Traditional liquidity charts often plot one variable at a time. This model adds clarity by:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Combining multiple macro liquidity components into a single blended series.</li>
      <li>Giving you full control over which components are included.</li>
      <li>Producing a smooth output that’s easier to compare with price.</li>
      <li>Providing multi-window correlation analysis so you can see when price and liquidity have moved together.</li>
      <li>Helping you explore whether liquidity tends to lead, lag, or coincide with price on your asset of interest.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      It’s most useful for macro-focused traders, swing traders, crypto/macro analysts, and anyone who wants 
      a transparent way to integrate liquidity into their framework.
    </p>

    <h2>What This Script Is Not</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Not a recreation of any commercial macro model.</li>
      <li>Not financial advice or a predictive tool.</li>
      <li>Not a proprietary liquidity algorithm.</li>
      <li>All calculations rely solely on publicly available FRED time series.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Use</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Select which liquidity components you want included.</li>
      <li>Adjust WALCL blending to emphasize or down-weight balance-sheet effects.</li>
      <li>Optionally apply smoothing or a time offset to test hypotheses about lead/lag.</li>
      <li>Observe liquidity trend direction relative to price.</li>
      <li>Use the correlation table to see which windows have historically tracked price best.</li>
      <li>Combine with structure, volume, and trend analysis for a full macro-technical picture.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Important Notes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>FRED data updates weekly and may revise historical values.</li>
      <li>Correlation does not imply causation – it measures relationship, not predictiveness.</li>
      <li>Liquidity models are approximations, not definitive macro forecasts.</li>
      <li>Always validate settings across multiple assets and timeframes.</li>
    </ul>
