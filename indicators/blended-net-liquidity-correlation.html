      <h1>Blended Net Liquidity Correlation</h1>

      <!-- CONTEXT -->
      <p>
        Many traders study macro liquidity to understand broader market conditions and potential influences on price.
        Liquidity-based indicators are often presented as complex or institutional-only, despite relying largely on public data.
      </p>

      <p>
        At a conceptual level, most liquidity models attempt to approximate how capital flows through the financial system
        by combining balance-sheet data, treasury operations, and short-term funding dynamics.
      </p>

      <p>
        This page explains that structure in plain language and provides a free implementation for study and experimentation.
        The indicator is free to use on TradingView; the script is protected.
      </p>

      <h2>How Traders Recreate This Without the Indicator</h2>

      <p>
        You can approximate similar liquidity views manually in TradingView using public data series and symbol math.
        The platform allows users to add, subtract, and transform series directly.
      </p>

      <p>
        A simple approach might involve:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Combining public balance sheet and liquidity series using symbol math (for example, WALCL − RRP − TGA).</li>
        <li>Applying smoothing (such as an SMA) to reduce noise.</li>
        <li>Comparing the resulting series against price on the same chart.</li>
        <li>Testing different offsets or timeframes to study lead/lag behavior.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        This indicator packages those steps into a structured workflow with configurable components and built-in correlation analysis.
      </p>

      <h2>Overview</h2>

      <p>
        Liquidity-based models are commonly used to study macro trends across equities, crypto, and other risk assets.
        While implementations vary, many rely on publicly available data from sources such as the Federal Reserve and U.S. Treasury.
      </p>

      <p>
        This script does not replicate or reverse-engineer any commercial macro model.
        Instead, it provides a transparent framework for exploring how different liquidity components interact
        and how those dynamics correlate with price over time.
      </p>

      <h2>What the Script Does</h2>

      <h3>1. Builds a blended net liquidity model</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Includes selectable components such as WALCL, RRP, TGA, BTFP, ΔTOTLL, and ΔM2.</li>
        <li>Allows each component to be toggled on or off.</li>
        <li>Supports adjustable weighting between balance-sheet and flow-based models.</li>
        <li>Applies optional SMA smoothing to the liquidity series.</li>
        <li>Supports time-offsetting to study lag effects.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. Runs multi-period correlation analysis</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Calculates correlation between liquidity and price over multiple windows.</li>
        <li>Includes short-term and long-term horizons.</li>
        <li>Highlights the strongest correlation window automatically.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Plots liquidity alongside price</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Uses a clean overlay format.</li>
        <li>Aligns liquidity trends visually with price structure.</li>
        <li>Helps contextualize macro conditions rather than generate signals.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why This Script Is Useful</h2>

      <p>
        Liquidity models are often discussed abstractly, without clear explanations of what inputs matter or how they affect results.
        This tool is useful because it:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Breaks macro liquidity into understandable components.</li>
        <li>Allows experimentation with different model constructions.</li>
        <li>Quantifies relationships using correlation instead of narrative.</li>
        <li>Encourages research rather than prediction.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        This makes it suitable for macro-focused traders, longer-term investors, and anyone studying how systemic liquidity interacts with price.
      </p>

      <h2>Important Notes</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>All data is sourced from public FRED datasets.</li>
        <li>FRED data updates weekly and may revise historical values.</li>
        <li>Correlation does not imply causation.</li>
        <li>Liquidity models are approximations, not forecasts.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Not signals. Not alerts. Not shortcuts.</strong></p>
      <p>The goal is to document how indicators work — not to tell anyone when to trade.</p>
      <p><strong>If an indicator can’t be explained down to its underlying mechanics, it probably isn’t understood well enough to trade.</strong></p>
