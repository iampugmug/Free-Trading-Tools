    <h1>Adaptive Dual MA Trend Ribbon Community “Larsson-Style” Presets</h1>

    <p class="section-intro body-text">
      A dual-moving-average “trend ribbon” for TradingView that allows traders to experiment with 
      SMMA / EMA / SMA / WMA pairs and optional ATR-based neutral zones.  
      The indicator is <strong>free to use</strong> on TradingView; the source code itself is published as protected.

    <!-- HOW TO RECREATE -->
    <h2>How Traders Recreate This Without the Indicator</h2>

    <p class="body-text">
      At its core, many so-called “Larsson-style” trend ribbons are based on a very simple idea:
      plotting two smoothed moving averages and observing how they interact over time.
    </p>

    <p class="body-text">
      If you want to recreate a similar structure manually in TradingView—without using this indicator—you can do the following:
    </p>

    <ol class="body-text">
      <li>Add a <strong>Smoothed Moving Average (SMMA)</strong> to your chart.</li>
      <li>Set its length to <strong>15</strong> and leave the remaining inputs at their defaults.</li>
      <li>Add a second Smoothed Moving Average with the length set to <strong>29</strong>.</li>
      <li>When the faster SMMA (15) moves above the slower SMMA (29), the trend bias is bullish.</li>
      <li>When the faster SMMA (15) moves below the slower SMMA (29), the trend bias is bearish.</li>
    </ol>

    <p class="body-text">
      Because moving averages are lagging by nature, this approach tends to work best on
      <strong>higher timeframes (daily and above)</strong> and during clear directional trends.
      It performs poorly in sideways or choppy markets, which is why many traders combine it
      with volatility filters, market structure, or other forms of confirmation.
    </p>

    <p class="body-text">
      The indicator provided here simply packages this concept into a cleaner visual ribbon,
      adds optional ATR-based neutral zones, and makes it easier to experiment with different
      moving-average types and lengths. You are free to explore and adjust these parameters
      as much as you like.
    </p>

    <!-- OVERVIEW -->
    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p class="body-text">
      Many traders enjoy experimenting with dual-moving-average “trend ribbon” structures that resemble
      the visual style of popular tools such as the Larsson Line. While the internal logic of closed-source
      indicators is not publicly available, the trading community has long explored MA combinations like
      SMMA 15/29 or EMA 30/60 with ATR filters to study trend transitions and visualize momentum shifts.
    </p>

    <p class="body-text">
      This indicator does <strong>not</strong> replicate, reverse-engineer, or replace any closed-source tool.
      Instead, it provides a flexible framework that allows traders to build their own trend-ribbon
      configuration inspired by similar visual concepts, while remaining transparent about inputs
      and behavior.
    </p>

    <!-- WHAT IT DOES -->
    <h2>What the Script Does</h2>

    <ul class="body-text">
      <li>Plots Fast and Slow moving averages using SMMA (RMA), EMA, SMA, or WMA.</li>
      <li>Colors the ribbon to show directional bias:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Bullish</strong> when Fast MA &gt; Slow MA</li>
          <li><strong>Bearish</strong> when Fast MA &lt; Slow MA</li>
          <li><strong>Neutral</strong> when the difference is small (optional ATR filter)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Supports ATR-based neutral zone filtering to highlight choppy conditions.</li>
      <li>Supports optional bar coloring by trend state.</li>
      <li>Works on any market and timeframe.</li>
      <li>Free public indicator; code is protected on TradingView.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- WHY USEFUL -->
    <h2>Why This Script Is Useful</h2>

    <p class="body-text">
      Traditional moving averages identify trend direction but often lack context during uncertain
      or low-momentum conditions. This ribbon adds structure in several ways:
    </p>

    <ol class="body-text">
      <li>Allows multiple smoothing techniques (SMMA / EMA / SMA / WMA).</li>
      <li>Highlights clearer transitions between bullish, bearish, and neutral phases.</li>
      <li>Uses ATR to flag low-confidence, sideways periods.</li>
      <li>Provides a visually intuitive band instead of a single line.</li>
    </ol>

    <p class="body-text">
      It is well-suited for swing traders, trend followers, and breakout traders who want a clean
      context filter to complement—not replace—their existing entry and risk rules.
    </p>

    <!-- COMMON PRESETS -->
    <h2>Common Community Presets</h2>

    <ul class="body-text">
      <li><strong>SMMA 15 / 29</strong> – smoother structural trend flow.</li>
      <li><strong>EMA 30 / 60</strong> – more responsive momentum shifts.</li>
      <li><strong>EMA 10 / 21</strong> – intraday rhythm.</li>
      <li><strong>EMA 50 / 100</strong> – higher-timeframe structure.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="body-text">
      These settings are commonly discussed within the trading community, but the indicator
      does not attempt to recreate or imitate any closed-source or commercial product.
    </p>

    <!-- HOW TO USE -->
    <h2>How to Use</h2>

    <ol class="body-text">
      <li>Choose your preferred moving-average type and lengths based on timeframe.</li>
      <li>Enable the ATR Neutral Zone if you want fewer noisy flips.</li>
      <li>Optionally color bars by trend for faster visual interpretation.</li>
      <li>Combine with structure, volume, and your own entry logic for confluence.</li>
    </ol>

    <!-- NOTES -->
    <h2>Important Notes</h2>

    <ul class="body-text">
      <li>The indicator is free to use; the source code is published as protected.</li>
      <li>It does not reproduce, imitate, or reverse-engineer any closed-source logic.</li>
      <li>All calculations rely on standard moving-average and ATR concepts.</li>
    </ul>
