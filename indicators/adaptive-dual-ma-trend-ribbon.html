      <h1>Adaptive Dual MA Trend Ribbon Community “Larsson-Style” Presets</h1>

      <!-- CONTEXT -->
      <p>
        Many traders encounter dual-moving-average “trend ribbon” indicators through popular tools such as the Larsson Line,
        often sold at price points that put them out of reach for many retail traders.
      </p>

      <p>
        At a conceptual level, most trend-ribbon indicators are built around a simple idea: plotting two smoothed moving averages
        and observing how they interact to define trend direction.
      </p>

      <p>
        This page explains that structure in plain language and provides a free implementation for study and experimentation.
        The indicator is free to use on TradingView; the script is protected.
      </p>

      <h2>How Traders Recreate This Without the Indicator</h2>

      <p>
        At its core, the different “Larsson-style” trend ribbons are based on a very simple idea:
        plotting two smoothed moving averages and observing how they interact over time.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you want to recreate a similar structure manually in TradingView—without using this indicator—you can do the following:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Add a <strong>Smoothed Moving Average (SMMA)</strong> to your chart.</li>
        <li>Set its length to <strong>15</strong> and leave the remaining inputs at their defaults.</li>
        <li>Add a second SMMA with the length set to <strong>29</strong>.</li>
        <li>When the faster SMMA (15) moves above the slower SMMA (29), the trend bias is bullish.</li>
        <li>When the faster SMMA (15) moves below the slower SMMA (29), the trend bias is bearish.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Because moving averages are lagging by nature, this tends to work best on <strong>daily and higher</strong> timeframes
        and during clear directional trends. It performs poorly in sideways markets, which is why many traders combine it with
        structure, volatility filters, or other confirmation tools.
      </p>

      <h2>Overview</h2>

      <p>
        Many traders enjoy experimenting with dual-moving-average “trend ribbon” structures that resemble the visual style of popular tools such as the Larsson Line.
        While the internal logic of closed-source indicators is not publicly available, the trading community often explores MA combinations like SMMA 15/29 or EMA 30/60
        with ATR filters to study trend transitions and visualize momentum shifts.
      </p>

      <p>
        This script does not replicate, reverse-engineer, or replace any closed-source indicator. Instead, it provides a flexible framework that lets traders build their own
        trend-ribbon configuration inspired by similar visual concepts while maintaining transparency around inputs and behavior.
      </p>

      <h2>What the Script Does</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Plots Fast and Slow moving averages using SMMA (RMA), EMA, SMA, or WMA.</li>
        <li>Colors the ribbon to show directional bias:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Bullish</strong> when Fast MA &gt; Slow MA</li>
            <li><strong>Bearish</strong> when Fast MA &lt; Slow MA</li>
            <li><strong>Neutral</strong> when the difference is small (optional ATR filter)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Supports ATR-based neutral zone filtering to reduce noise during low momentum conditions.</li>
        <li>Supports optional bar coloring tied to trend state.</li>
        <li>Works on all markets and timeframes.</li>
        <li>Indicator is free to use on TradingView; script is protected.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why This Script Is Useful</h2>

      <p>
        Traditional moving averages identify trend direction but often lack context during uncertain or low-momentum conditions.
        This ribbon framework adds clarity by:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Allowing multiple smoothing techniques (SMMA/EMA/SMA/WMA)</li>
        <li>Highlighting cleaner trend transitions</li>
        <li>Identifying low-confidence periods using an ATR neutral zone</li>
        <li>Providing a visually intuitive ribbon instead of single-line signals</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Suitable for swing traders, trend followers, breakout traders, and anyone who wants cleaner structure-based contextualization.
      </p>

      <h2>Popular Community MA Combinations</h2>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>SMMA 15 / 29</strong> → smoother structural trend flow</li>
        <li><strong>EMA 30 / 60</strong> → more responsive momentum shifts</li>
        <li><strong>EMA 10 / 21</strong> → intraday rhythm</li>
        <li><strong>EMA 50 / 100</strong> → higher-timeframe structure</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        These examples are commonly used by the community — but this script does not recreate or imitate any closed-source or commercial indicator.
      </p>

      <h2>How to Use</h2>

      <ol>
        <li>Choose your preferred MA type.</li>
        <li>Adjust Fast/Slow lengths to match your timeframe.</li>
        <li>Enable ATR Neutral Zone to reduce false flips in choppy conditions.</li>
        <li>Optionally enable bar coloring.</li>
        <li>Combine with structure, volume, or price action for decision-making.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Important Notes</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Free to use on TradingView; script is protected.</li>
        <li>Moving averages lag and perform poorly in sideways markets.</li>
        <li>Use alongside other technical tools for confluence.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Not signals. Not alerts. Not shortcuts.</strong></p>
      <p>The goal is to document how indicators work — not to tell anyone when to trade.</p>
      <p><strong>If an indicator can’t be explained down to its underlying mechanics, it probably isn’t understood well enough to trade.</strong></p>
