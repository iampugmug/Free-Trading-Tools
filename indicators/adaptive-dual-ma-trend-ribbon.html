      <h1>Adaptive Dual MA Trend Ribbon Community “Larsson-Style” Presets</h1>

      <p class="section-intro">
        A dual-moving-average “trend ribbon” for TradingView that allows traders to experiment with SMMA / EMA / SMA / WMA pairs and optional ATR-based neutral zones.

      <h2>How Traders Recreate This Without the Indicator</h2>

      <p>
        At its core, many so-called “Larsson-style” trend ribbons are based on a very simple idea:
        plotting two smoothed moving averages and observing how they interact over time.
      </p>

      <p>If you want to recreate a similar structure manually in TradingView, you can do the following:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Add a <strong>Smoothed Moving Average (SMMA)</strong> to your chart.</li>
        <li>Set its length to <strong>15</strong> and leave the remaining inputs at their defaults.</li>
        <li>Add a second Smoothed Moving Average with the length set to <strong>29</strong>.</li>
        <li>When the faster SMMA (15) moves above the slower SMMA (29), the trend bias is bullish.</li>
        <li>When the faster SMMA (15) moves below the slower SMMA (29), the trend bias is bearish.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Because moving averages are lagging by nature, this approach tends to work best on <strong>higher timeframes (daily and above)</strong>
        and during clear directional trends. It performs poorly in sideways or choppy markets, which is why many traders combine it with volatility filters,
        market structure, or other forms of confirmation.
      </p>

      <p>
        The indicator provided here packages this concept into a cleaner visual ribbon, adds optional ATR-based neutral zones,
        and makes it easier to experiment with different moving-average types and lengths.
      </p>

      <h2>Overview</h2>

      <p>
        Many traders enjoy experimenting with dual-moving-average “trend ribbon” structures that resemble the visual style of popular tools such as the Larsson Line.
        While the internal logic of closed-source indicators is not publicly available, the trading community often explores MA combinations like SMMA 15/29 or EMA 30/60
        with ATR filters to study trend transitions and visualize momentum shifts.
      </p>

      <p>
        This indicator does <strong>not</strong> replicate, reverse-engineer, or replace any closed-source tool.
        Instead, it provides a flexible framework that lets traders build their own trend-ribbon configuration inspired by similar visual concepts.
      </p>

      <h2>What the Script Does</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Plots Fast and Slow moving averages using SMMA (RMA), EMA, SMA, or WMA.</li>
        <li>Colors the ribbon to show directional bias:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Bullish</strong> when Fast MA &gt; Slow MA</li>
            <li><strong>Bearish</strong> when Fast MA &lt; Slow MA</li>
            <li><strong>Neutral</strong> when the difference is small (optional ATR filter)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Supports ATR-based neutral zone filtering to highlight choppy conditions.</li>
        <li>Supports optional bar coloring by trend state.</li>
        <li>Works on any market and timeframe.</li>
        <li>Free public indicator; code is protected on TradingView.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why This Script Is Useful</h2>
      <p>
        Traditional moving averages identify trend direction but often lack context during uncertain or low-momentum conditions.
        This ribbon adds structure in a few ways:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Allows multiple smoothing techniques (SMMA / EMA / SMA / WMA).</li>
        <li>Highlights clearer transitions between bullish, bearish, and neutral phases.</li>
        <li>Uses ATR to flag low-confidence, sideways periods.</li>
        <li>Provides a visually intuitive band instead of a single line.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
