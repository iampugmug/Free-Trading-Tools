      <h1>Adaptive Dual MA Trend Ribbon Community “Larsson-Style” Presets</h1>

      <p class="section-intro">
        A dual-moving-average “trend ribbon” for TradingView that allows traders to experiment with SMMA / EMA / SMA / WMA pairs and optional ATR-based neutral zones.
        The indicator is <strong>free to use</strong> on TradingView; the source code itself is published as protected.

      <h2>How Traders Recreate This Without the Indicator</h2>

      <p>
        At its core, the different “Larsson-style” trend ribbons are based on a very simple idea:
        plotting two smoothed moving averages and observing how they interact over time.
      </p>

      <p>If you want to recreate a similar structure manually in TradingView, you can do the following:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Add a <strong>Smoothed Moving Average (SMMA)</strong> to your chart.</li>
        <li>Set its length to <strong>15</strong> and leave the remaining inputs at their defaults.</li>
        <li>Add a second Smoothed Moving Average with the length set to <strong>29</strong>.</li>
        <li>When the faster SMMA (15) moves above the slower SMMA (29), the trend bias is bullish.</li>
        <li>When the faster SMMA (15) moves below the slower SMMA (29), the trend bias is bearish.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Because moving averages are lagging by nature, this approach tends to work best on <strong>higher timeframes (daily and above)</strong>
        and during clear directional trends. It performs poorly in sideways or choppy markets, which is why many traders combine it with volatility filters,
        market structure, or other forms of confirmation.
      </p>

      <p>
        The indicator provided here packages this concept into a cleaner visual ribbon, adds optional ATR-based neutral zones,
        and makes it easier to experiment with different moving-average types and lengths.
      </p>

      <h2>Overview</h2>

      <p>
        Many traders enjoy experimenting with dual-moving-average “trend ribbon” structures that resemble the visual style of popular tools such as the Larsson Line.
        While the internal logic of closed-source indicators is not publicly available, the trading community often explores MA combinations like SMMA 15/29 or EMA 30/60
        with ATR filters to study trend transitions and visualize momentum shifts.
      </p>

      <p>
        This indicator does <strong>not</strong> replicate, reverse-engineer, or replace any closed-source tool.
        Instead, it provides a flexible framework that lets traders build their own trend-ribbon configuration inspired by similar visual concepts.
